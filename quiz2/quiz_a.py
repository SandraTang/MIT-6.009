def k_queens_coverage(k, size):
    """
    Checks if it is possible to place less than or equal to 'k' queens on a
    chess board of size 'size' such that every cell on the board is
    reachable by at least one queen and no two queens can attack each other.
    Returns any such board if it is possible, otherwise returns None.

    Given:
        k: the maximum number of queens you may place on the board
        size: size of the chess board

    Returns:
        A 1-D array of length size representing any board that satisfies
        the problem. Each index (i) in the array represents column i of the
        board. If there is a queen placed on column i, array[i] must equal
        the row index of the queen. If no queen is placed on column i,
        array[i] = -1. If there is no such board that satisfies the problem,
        return None.
